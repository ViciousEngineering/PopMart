These are PC FireFox browser extensions for PopMart.  I'll try to provide as much support as possible.
**I guarantee NOTHING! Spamming links will get you restricted on the popmart website!**

Updated 06/08/2025 #1 - coded for any region, fixed ID url issue & added link color change after clicking.  
Updated 06/08/2025 #2 - updated to open the generated link tab in the same window and next to the source of the box numnber

Reach out to me on reddit for issues &/or request, u/CoCoHimself

I accidentally deleted the readme...womp womp I'm building it back slowly.

<ins>**Extensions**</ins>  
* **Link Generator** - When you go to a Pop-Now item the extension grabs the box number & creates a new tab with links you can easily click.  You can set the number of links to gen & at what increment.

* **ADD TO BAG** - Selects everything in the select multiple popup window & adds them to bag as fast as dang diddly possible.

**Note:**  You will need to re-add them if you compltetly close FireFox

<ins>**How to Use**</ins>

  **Note:** Because of how PopMart webpages are loaded while navigating & my very limited knowledge on its coding, extensions only run when opening a new tab for the item or refreshing the page with a <ins>**Trigger link**</ins>.

**Link Generator**  
 1. Only works on Base Trigger links.  This is to prevent new link tabs being created everytime you click a Box Set link.  

 2. Set the incriment & number of links to generate [Clip](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/afd4a48b-dee3-4f69-a4f8-32c164dccbe0).  

 3. Open in new tab or refresh if already opened, for link generation [Clip](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/08115b93-eba1-478f-8fb4-9e2adb1725b1).
