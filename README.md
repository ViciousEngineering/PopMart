These are PC FireFox browser extensions for PopMart.  I'll try to provide as much support as possible.
**I guarantee NOTHING! Spamming links will get you restricted on the popmart website!**

Updated 06/08/2025 - coded for any region, fixed ID url issue & added link color change after clicking.

Reach out to me on reddit for issues &/or request, u/CoCoHimself

I accidentally deleted the readme...womp womp I'm building it back slowly.

<ins>**Extensions**</ins>  
* **Link Generator** - When you go to a Pop-Now item the extension grabs the box number & creates a new tab with links you can easily click.  You can set the number of links to gen & at what increment.

* **ADD TO BAG** - Selects everything in the select multiple popup window & adds them to bag as fast as dang diddly possible.
